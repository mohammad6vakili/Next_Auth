# NextJs Authentication

This is a `Next.js` project based on `Typescript`.

Check Live Demo [Here](https://631091d4b518565d01a53a95--comfy-meringue-12258d.netlify.app/)

# Installation

Please clone the repository and run `npm i` in terminal in the root directory.

Then run `npm run dev`.

And at the end Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

# Instruction
This system works completely on your local and uses your `localStorage` to store your data.

Also I used `Redux` for manage global states when needed.

# System Flow

- Register your information through the Signup form.
- Enter the dashboard using the login form according to the registered information.
- Then you can Logout from the dashboard and register a new user.
